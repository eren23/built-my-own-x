# Day 27

Today I continued to work on some other concepts about map making in general, again with Phaser examples. Today's subject was matterjs again but with other features and now a moving character from our earlier studies.

Source I used is [here](https://itnext.io/modular-game-worlds-in-phaser-3-tilemaps-5-matter-physics-platformer-d14d1f614557) and the code source is [here](https://github.com/mikewesthad/phaser-3-tilemap-blog-posts/tree/master/examples/post-5)
