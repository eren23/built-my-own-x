# Day 3

Day3 of the built-my-x, I tried to work that naive chain project by following the tutorials from [here](https://github.com/lhartikk/naivechain) and [here](https://medium.com/@lhartikk/a-blockchain-in-200-lines-of-code-963cc1cc0e54),
to add here I deleted the existing repo and initilaized a new one. The original ones are given below you can check that out how to build from there.
