# Day 24

Today I started to work on some other concepts about map making in general, again with Phaser examples. Today's topics were about static map generation with or without tile editors.

Source I used is [here](https://medium.com/@michaelwesthadley/modular-game-worlds-in-phaser-3-tilemaps-1-958fc7e6bbd6) and code I used is [here](https://github.com/mikewesthad/phaser-3-tilemap-blog-posts/tree/master/examples/post-1)

Update:

I worked on another part of the same series. Worked mostly on the dynamic map generation.
